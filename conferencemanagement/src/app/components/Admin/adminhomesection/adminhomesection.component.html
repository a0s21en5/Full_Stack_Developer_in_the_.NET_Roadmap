          <div class="postcard__preview-txt">The best place for people to gather when working together on a business
  
            problem is in a well-equipped conference room. When you put people in a defined space, removed from their
  
            cubicles or the chaos of an open floor plan, you physically unite a team of people. Conference room tech also
  
            contributes to a problem-solving session. A well-designed conference room includes tools that foster easy
  
            collaboration, such as a big-screen monitor, an all-in-one video conferencing solution, and whiteboards for
  
            impromptu writing, drawing, and more.</div>
